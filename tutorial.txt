Thanks for using my open source self-bot! I am NOT responsible for repercussions caused by using this code
as self bots are against Discord TOS so use at your own discretion...My recommendation is to use an alt.

You'll need to have Python installed on your computer with path before you can use this (obviously)

Open a command prompt/terminal and navigate to the directory (cd filename) with the selfbot in it
and type:
pip install -r requirements.txt

You need to input your Discord token to use this. If you don't know how, search it up.

Run the jiqiren.py file

You may edit the prefix (default is "lol " and change token in the config.json.

Love,
